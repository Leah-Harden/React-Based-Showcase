                <p>I was raised in Orlando, Florida, but I was born in China. People often tell me that I have a logical way of thinking, which is not surprising since math has always been my passion. As a child, I used to disassemble objects to understand their inner workings. I feel the same way about coding; it's fascinating to uncover how a system functions. There is no better feeling than successfully programming a machine.</p>
